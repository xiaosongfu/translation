"Microservices" - yet another new term on the crowded streets of software architecture. Although our natural inclination is to pass such things by with a contemptuous glance, this bit of terminology describes a style of software systems that we are finding more and more appealing. We've seen many projects use this style in the last few years, and results so far have been positive, so much so that for many of our colleagues this is becoming the default style for building enterprise applications. Sadly, however, there's not much information that outlines what the microservice style is and how to do it.

“微服务” - 在拥挤的软件架构街道上又一个新名词。虽然我们的自然倾向是通过轻蔑的眼神来传递这些东西，但这一点术语描述了一种我们发现越来越有吸引力的软件系统的风格。我们已经看到许多项目在过去几年中使用了这种风格，到目前为止的结果是积极的，以至于对于我们的许多同事而言，这已经成为构建企业应用程序的默认风格。然而，遗憾的是，没有太多信息可以概述微服务的风格以及如何实现。
